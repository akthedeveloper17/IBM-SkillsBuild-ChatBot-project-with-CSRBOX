# AI Virtual Assistant Web Project🤖

✅ Project Title: Coding Skill Developer — AI Chatbot Integration

✅ Website Link: codingskilldeveloper.netlify.app

✅ Tools Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, IBM Watson Assistant (via IBM SkillsBuild)

🌐 Project Overview:

As part of my IBM internship training, I successfully built and deployed a fully functional AI Assistant chatbot on a professional educational website, Coding Skill Developer. This AI Assistant, named Codey, is developed using IBM Watson Assistant, integrated into a custom-built front-end web application to serve as a virtual guide for learners.

The chatbot is designed to simulate a real-time assistant, helping users navigate available programming and development courses with a friendly, interactive experience. All key interactions are tailored to user input, delivering informative, contextually aware responses.

🔧 Key Features Implemented:
💬 Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Built using IBM Watson Assistant, the chatbot understands and responds to user queries in real time.

🧠 Dynamic Dialog Flow
Created multiple nodes and intent flows to respond to a wide variety of questions, such as:

👉 “Tell me about your courses”

👉 “What types of development programs do you offer?”

👉 “Do you provide certification?”

🎯 Course Suggestion System

🟢Based on user interest, Codey suggests different paths:

🟢Development Courses: Web, Mobile, App, Full Stack

🟢Programming Courses: Python, Java, JavaScript, etc.

🟢Main Courses: Curated learning paths

🖼️ Visual Interface

➤ Integrated with a modern and visually rich landing page that includes:

➤ Custom avatars representing instructors

➤ Skill categories (Frontend, Backend)

➤ Language logos and design elements

➤ Floating chatbot panel with smooth animation

🛠️ Built with Web Technologies:

🚀 HTML5 & CSS3 for structured layout and styling

🚀 JavaScript for chatbot widget integration

🚀 IBM Watson Assistant embedded via script and API keys

✅ All chatbot interactions are fully tested and simulate realistic user experience for a learning platform.

🚀 Outcome and Learning:

✔️ Through this project, I gained real-world experience in:

✔️ Designing conversational UX using IBM Watson Assistant

✔️ Deploying AI chat systems on live websites

✔️ Front-end development and chatbot embedding

✔️ API configuration, chatbot training, and logic structuring

This chatbot not only demonstrates my AI integration skills but also showcases my ability to develop real-time interactive web experiences for educational platforms.
