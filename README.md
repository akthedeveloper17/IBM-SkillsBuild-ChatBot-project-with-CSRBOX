🌐 Project Overview:
As part of my IBM internship training, I successfully built and deployed a fully functional AI Assistant chatbot on a professional educational website, Coding Skill Developer. This AI Assistant, named Codey, is developed using IBM Watson Assistant, integrated into a custom-built front-end web application to serve as a virtual guide for learners.

The chatbot is designed to simulate a real-time assistant, helping users navigate available programming and development courses with a friendly, interactive experience. All key interactions are tailored to user input, delivering informative, contextually aware responses.

🔧 Key Features Implemented:
💬 Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Built using IBM Watson Assistant, the chatbot understands and responds to user queries in real time.

🧠 Dynamic Dialog Flow
Created multiple nodes and intent flows to respond to a wide variety of questions, such as:

“Tell me about your courses”

“What types of development programs do you offer?”

“Do you provide certification?”

🎯 Course Suggestion System
Based on user interest, Codey suggests different paths:

Development Courses: Web, Mobile, App, Full Stack

Programming Courses: Python, Java, JavaScript, etc.

Main Courses: Curated learning paths

🖼️ Visual Interface
Integrated with a modern and visually rich landing page that includes:

Custom avatars representing instructors

Skill categories (Frontend, Backend)

Language logos and design elements

Floating chatbot panel with smooth animation

🛠️ Built with Web Technologies:

HTML5 & CSS3 for structured layout and styling

JavaScript for chatbot widget integration

IBM Watson Assistant embedded via script and API keys

📸 Project Demonstration:
Here are some screenshots showing the functionality of the AI assistant:

✅ All chatbot interactions are fully tested and simulate realistic user experience for a learning platform.

🚀 Outcome and Learning:
Through this project, I gained real-world experience in:

Designing conversational UX using IBM Watson Assistant

Deploying AI chat systems on live websites

Front-end development and chatbot embedding

API configuration, chatbot training, and logic structuring

This chatbot not only demonstrates my AI integration skills but also showcases my ability to develop real-time interactive web experiences for educational platforms.
